# iNotebook

This repository contains the code of a cloud notebook app using MERN stack, Bootstrap, Animate CSS & Materials Icon etc. The project creates the visual designs, animations, different sections, databases & all other parts which are required and necessary for building a notebook application.



## Features

- Responsive design: The web page adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience on desktop & mobile devices.
- Interactive components: The page includes interactive elements such as buttons, cards, animations & other hover effects on buttons.
- CSS styling: The stylesheets provide a sleek and modern look.
- Animations: Very smart & simple animations appears when switching into different sections.
- UI Tracking: By using Trackvisiblity, the current position of user on the page can be tracked down in order to improve UI experience.
- Backend Database: The backend of iNotebook is linked with MongoDB Atlas to store & fetch data, fast and secure.
- Hashing: By means of hashing, your passwords are end-to-end encrypted and cannot be viewed, hacked or shared. 
- Authenticator - By the use of JSON Web Token, chances of phishing are minimized & user info is limited to that specific user only.

# Getting Started with Create React App (Front-End Only)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
